# Weather_Trend_Analytics_Across_Indian_Cities
A data analytics project that studies long-term and short-term weather patterns across major Indian cities. Includes data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, seasonal trend detection, forecasting experiments and an interactive Streamlit for visualization.

Overview:

This project analyses historical weather data for major Indian cities, including temperature (max & min), humidity, precipitation, wind speed, wind direction and pressure. It identifies trends, regional differences and emerging climate patterns using statistical analysis and visualizations.

Objectives:

- Analyse long-term trends of weather parameters across cities.
- Compare temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind and pressure region-wise
-	Visualize trends with charts and graphs
- Perform basic forecasting of future weather trends

Methodology:

1.	Data Collection: Historical datasets from Open-Meteo API.
2.	Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates and date formatting
3.	EDA: Yearly/monthly averages, min/max values, anomalies
4.	Visualization: Line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, city-wise comparisons
5.	Forecasting: Linear Regression for predicting future trends

Tech Stack:
-	Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
-	Tools: Google Colab, Git, GitHub
-	Data Sources: Open-Meteo (Historical Weather API)

Expected Outcomes:
-	Visual trends of temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind, and pressure
-	City-wise climate comparisons
- Basic future trend forecasting
